I'm a [human being](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) living in Toronto. I like Clojure, Ruby, application security, and teaching other people about those things.

I hack things and build products at [State Machinery](http://state.io), a
computer security and software development consultancy I co-founded.
We built [gemcanary](https://gemcanary.com) to help Ruby users
monitor their dependencies for vulnerabilities, and we
organize [RubySec](http://www.rubysec.com/) to provide security
resources for the Ruby community.

In the summer of 2014, I went to
[Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/), an awesome retreat for
programmers. During that time, I helped improve the state of Java
security by
[injecting lolcats](http://blog.ontoillogical.com/blog/2014/07/28/how-to-take-over-any-java-developer/)
into software updates.

## Also
I discovered a way to track the location of Tinder users by [using trigonometry](http://blog.includesecurity.com/2014/02/how-i-was-able-to-track-location-of-any.html). [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2014/02/18/tinder-dating-app-users-are-playing-with-privacy-fire/) and [Businessweek](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-19/new-tinder-security-flaw-exposed-users-exact-locations-for-months
) wrote about it.

I organize [BSidesTO](http://bsidesto.ca), a relaxed security conference in Toronto.
